  <h2> About </h2>
  <p>  Im a 1st year Masters student in Signal and image processing at NIT Rourkela
       previously i received my bachelors in robotics and automation engineering .
       i have worked on image classification, image segmentation , video object segmentation
       and my current research interest is deep unsupervised learning. Video data carry a lot 
       more information than images given it's multimodal nature and my goal is to build a model that 
       can efficiently understand video audio signals in synchronization and help humans automate tasks
